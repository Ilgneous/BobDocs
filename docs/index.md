## Vehicle Model Structure

BobDyn models the vehicle as a hierarchy of physical systems. The structure is
kept explicit so geometry, loads, constraints, and response signals can be
traced from full-vehicle behavior down to subsystem assumptions.

This is central to the project philosophy: transparency starts with knowing
where each piece of vehicle behavior lives in the model.

Start with [BobDyn/BobSim](/bobsim/) for app-guided vehicle setup, simulation
workflows, case execution, metrics, plots, and reports. Go to
[BobDyn/BobLib](/boblib/) when you want to inspect, modify, or debug the
low-level vehicle models directly.

## A physical model for vehicle characterization

Vehicles are dynamic systems, and the driver experiences their response rather than their equations. BobDyn is built around that idea: use meaningful response metrics, keep the model inspectable, and make every study traceable from configuration to report.

BobDyn/BobLib provides the physical vehicle model in Modelica. BobDyn/BobSim takes that model, runs repeatable studies, extracts signals, and turns the results into plots, metrics, and reports.

The result is a workflow for generating simulation ground truth that you can inspect, compare, and reuse across design iterations.

## What BobDyn enables

|Capability|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Standard tests**|Run repeatable studies such as steady-state cornering, transient steering response, and kinematics/compliance workflows.|
|**Automated reporting**|Turn simulation output into metrics, plots, CSV files, and engineering reports without hand-built post-processing.|
|**Model correlation**|Use full-system simulation results as reference data for reduced-order models, design tools, and simplifying assumptions.|
|**Design exploration**|Sweep parameters, compare configurations, and see how physical changes propagate through vehicle-level behavior.|

## Sample Outputs

The animations below are two input samples: one closed-loop PI control example
and one open-loop prescribed-frequency input example.

## Minimal Worked Example

The fastest user path downloads the BobSim desktop app from the
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/BobDyn/BobSim/releases/latest), extracts
it, and runs `BobSim`.

For source-checkout development, launch the same app locally:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BobDyn/BobSim.git
cd BobSim
make init
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make app
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` and follow:

```text
Setup -> Save Vehicle -> Write to MBD -> Simulation -> Archive
```

![BobSim app showing the guided Setup view with vehicle architecture controls and preview](/images/bobsim/app-setup-architecture.png)

For a scripted release baseline:

```bash
make docker-build
make standard-eval-all
```

The `standard-eval-all` target builds the required Modelica executables when
they are missing, then runs RampSteerEval, SteadyStateEval, TransientEval, and
FourPostEval. The expected review artifacts are PDF reports and metrics CSVs
under `_3_StandardSim/generated_results/` and, for CLI-oriented configs,
`_3_StandardSim/results/`.

## Transparent by design

BobDyn is built to eliminate black-box behavior through an explicit, inspectable, and reproducible simulation pipeline.

- **Physical models are defined from first principles**  
  Geometry, constraints, and force generation are implemented directly in Modelica.

- **Configuration is human-readable**  
  Vehicle records, test setups, and simulation parameters are defined in plain-text YAML and Modelica `.mo` files.

- **Execution is visible and scriptable**  
  Simulation, extraction, analysis, and reporting workflows are implemented in Python and designed to be built upon, modified, or replaced.

- **Results are directly traceable**  
  Outputs can be linked back to the model structure, configuration, and equations that produced them.

All models, solvers, workflows, and reports come from plain-text, version-controlled sources.
