# Development

This page covers the practical operations around BobDyn/BobSim: cloning,
app launch, environment setup, make targets, local Python, cleanup, quality
checks, and common failure paths.

## Clone

For simulation workflows, clone BobSim with submodules. BobLib is included as a
submodule.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BobDyn/BobSim.git
cd BobSim
```

If the repository is already cloned without submodules:

```bash
make init
```

The BobLib submodule lives at:

```text
_0_Utils/external/BobLib/
```

Clone BobLib directly only when you want to work on the low-level Modelica model
layer without the BobSim workflow wrapper.

## App Launch

The app is the normal local entry point for setup, simulation launch, and result
review. For users, prefer the released BobSim desktop executable. For
development, run the same app from a source checkout.

From the BobSim root:

```bash
make app
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

![BobSim app Setup view after launch, showing guided setup tabs and vehicle preview](/images/bobsim/app-setup-architecture.png)

The app runs in the Python environment that launched it. Install
`requirements.txt` locally before using `make app`; install OpenModelica locally
before building or running simulations from the app, or select a local
OpenModelica install from the app's Simulation toolchain selector.

Released desktop builds store generated user data in the per-user runtime
workspace:

| Platform | Default runtime root |
| :-- | :-- |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BobDyn\BobSim` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/BobDyn/BobSim` |
| Linux | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/BobDyn/BobSim` |

Set `BOBSIM_HOME` to override that location. `BOBDYN_HOME` remains supported
for older local installs.

## Desktop Release Builds

BobSim desktop artifacts are PyInstaller builds. They bundle the app frontend
and Python backend, but intentionally do not bundle generated Modelica
simulation executables, reports, app caches, or user workspaces.

Build the current platform's executable/app bundle:

```bash
make deploy
```

Clean, build, and package a release artifact:

```bash
make deploy-release DEPLOY_VERSION=2026.06.28
```

Release assets are platform-native. A Linux machine creates the Linux archive,
a Windows machine creates the Windows zip, and macOS creates the macOS zip.
The repository's `Release Builds` GitHub Actions workflow builds all three
when a `v*` tag is pushed and uploads them to the GitHub Release with
`--clobber`.

Deploy outputs are written under:

```text
_0_Utils/deploy/dist/BobSim/
_0_Utils/deploy/dist/releases/
```

## Docker Environment

BobSim ships with a Docker image based on:

```text
openmodelica/openmodelica:v1.26.3-ompython
```

The Dockerfile installs:

- OpenModelica runtime
- Modelica Standard Library `4.1.0`
- VehicleInterfaces `2.0.2`
- Python virtual environment under `/opt/venv`
- BobSim Python requirements
- plotting, reporting, PyVista, and video dependencies

Build the image:

```bash
make docker-build
```

Rebuild from scratch:

```bash
make docker-rebuild
```

Open shells:

```bash
make shell
make shell-standard
make shell-envelope
make shell-opt
```

The compose services mount the repository into `/workspace` and set
`PYTHONPATH=/workspace`.

## Local Python

The container is the most repeatable path, but local development is possible if
OpenModelica and Python dependencies are installed.

BobSim commonly uses the repository-local virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create it from scratch:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify the basics:

```bash
python --version
omc --version
python -c "import yaml, scipy, pandas, matplotlib; print('ok')"
```

VisualSim also needs the PyVista/Qt/VTK stack and FFmpeg support through
ImageIO.

## Make Target Reference

Setup and shell targets:

| Target | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| `make init` | Initialize/update git submodules |
| `make app` | Launch the local BobSim browser app |
| `make deploy` | Build the native desktop artifact for the current OS |
| `make deploy-package` | Package the current deploy artifact for release |
| `make deploy-release` | Clean, build, and package a release artifact |
| `make deploy-clean` | Remove deploy outputs |
| `make docker-build` | Build the Docker image |
| `make docker-rebuild` | Rebuild the Docker image without cache |
| `make shell` | Open the main BobSim shell |
| `make shell-standard` | Open a StandardSim shell |
| `make shell-envelope` | Open an EnvelopeSim shell |
| `make shell-opt` | Open an OptSim shell |

StandardSim targets:

| Target | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| `make standard-build` | Build the integrated `VehicleSim` entry point |
| `make standard-build-four-post` | Build the integrated `FourPostSim` entry point |
| `make standard-eval-ramp-steer` | Run RampSteerEval |
| `make standard-eval-steady-state` | Run SteadyStateEval |
| `make standard-eval-transient` | Run TransientEval |
| `make standard-eval-four-post` | Run FourPostEval |
| `make standard-eval-all` | Run all standard evaluations |

Envelope and OptSim targets:

| Target | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| `make envelope-ggv` | Run GGV envelope generation |
| `make envelope-ymd` | Run YMD envelope generation |
| `make envelope-all` | Run all envelope outputs |
| `make opt-standard` | Run StandardSens pre-screen sensitivities |
| `make opt-envelope` | Run EnvelopeSens sensitivities |
| `make opt-refined` | Run StandardSens refined response surfaces |

Quality and cleanup targets:

| Target | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| `make lint` | Run Ruff checks |
| `make typecheck` | Run MyPy checks |
| `make test` | Run pytest regression checks |
| `make ci` | Run lint, typecheck, and tests |
| `make clean` | Remove Python and tool caches |
| `make clean-standard` | Remove StandardSim build/result artifacts |
| `make clean-envelope` | Remove EnvelopeSim build/result artifacts |
| `make clean-opt` | Remove OptSim build/result artifacts |
| `make clean-all` | Run all cleanup targets |

## Quality Checks

Run the release gate:

```bash
make ci
```

That expands to:

```bash
make lint
make typecheck
make test
```

GitHub Actions runs the same targets with the BobLib submodule checked out
recursively. The pytest suite includes release-polish checks that assert the
public make target language stays coherent.

## Recommended Loops

For normal browser-based work:

```bash
make app
```

Then use `Setup`, `Simulation`, and `Archive`.

![BobSim app Simulation catalog used for normal browser-based workflow runs](/images/bobsim/app-simulation-catalog.png)

For standard maneuver work:

```bash
make standard-build
make standard-eval-ramp-steer
make standard-eval-steady-state
make standard-eval-transient
```

For suspension/K&C work:

```bash
make standard-build-four-post
make standard-eval-four-post
```

For envelope work:

```bash
make standard-eval-four-post
make envelope-all
```

For sensitivity work:

```bash
make clean-opt
make opt-standard
make opt-envelope
```

For a public-release check:

```bash
make standard-eval-all
make ci
```

Add `make envelope-all` when you intentionally want the optional envelope
artifacts as part of the release package.

## Troubleshooting

`Executable not found`

The workflow build directory does not contain the compiled OpenModelica
executable. Run `make standard-build` or `make standard-build-four-post`.

`Init XML not found`

The OpenModelica build did not complete cleanly. Clean the matching build
directory and rebuild.

`BobLib not found`

The submodule is missing or the path in a config is wrong. Run:

```bash
make init
```

`Modelica package cannot load`

Use the Docker path first. For local installs, confirm OpenModelica can find
Modelica Standard Library `4.1.0` and VehicleInterfaces `2.0.2`.

`yaml` import fails

Install BobSim requirements in the Python environment that is running the app or
workflow:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`omc` is missing from the app run log

Open the app's OpenModelica toolchain selector and choose the `omc` executable
plus the OpenModelica library directory. If auto-detection fails, common
library defaults are `%APPDATA%\.openmodelica\libraries` on Windows and
`~/.openmodelica/libraries` on macOS/Linux. For source-checkout CLI work, use
the Docker-backed workflow targets when local OpenModelica is not available.

`Simulation fails but no run directory remains`

Set `execution.cleanup: false` in the workflow config and rerun. Then inspect
the retained run directory under the build tree.

`OptSim population mismatch`

Sample count or variable dimensions changed while old variants remained on
disk. Run:

```bash
make clean-opt
```

then rerun the relevant `make opt-*` target.

`Visual render fails on import`

Install the visualization dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and prefer the
Docker shell if local Qt/VTK/PyVista packages are difficult to align.
