# Contributing to BobDocs

BobDocs uses **VitePress**, which turns simple text files (Markdown) into the website you see online.

---

## The Rules of the Road

To keep the documentation stable and high-quality, we follow a simple workflow.

1. **Protect the Main Branch**: You cannot upload changes directly to the `main` branch. It is "protected," meaning it only accepts changes that have been reviewed.
2. **Use Branches**: Always create a new "feature branch" for your work (e.g., `update-metrics` or `fix-typo`).
3. **Push to Remote**: You'll upload your branch to GitHub and create a **Pull Request (PR)**.
4. **Pass CI Checks**: Our automated system (CI) will check your work for errors. These checks must pass before your changes can be merged into the main site.

## Step-by-Step Setup

If you don't have the code on your computer yet, follow these steps:

1. **Get the Code**:

    Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BobDyn/BobDocs.git
    cd BobDocs
    ```

2. **Install Tools**:

    Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **See Your Changes Live**:

    Run this command to start a private version of the website on your computer:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. As you save files, the page will update automatically!

## How to Contribute (The Workflow)

### 1. Create a Branch

Before you start typing, create a new branch:

```bash
git switch -c your-branch-name
```

### 2. Write Your Content

Most of the work happens in the `docs/` folder. Files end in `.md` (Markdown).

* **Frontmatter**: Every file needs a small header at the very top:

    ```markdown
    ---
    layout: doc
    title: Your Page Title
    ---
    ```

* **Math**: We support LaTeX!

    Inline: `$a = F/m$`

    Blocks:

    ```markdown
    $$
    a_y = \frac{v^2}{R}
    $$
    ```

* **Headings**: Use `#` for the big title, `##` for sections, and `###` for sub-sections.

### 3. Add to the Navigation (If needed)

If you created a *new* file, add a single entry to `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` — just a page title and URL path. The `##` section headings in your file are picked up automatically; you don't need to list them manually.

If you're editing an *existing* file, renaming or adding `##` headings is all you need — the sidebar updates on the next build with no config change required.

### 4. Check for Errors

Run the build command to make sure there are no broken links or math errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Submit Your Work

Once you're happy with your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Briefly explain what you changed"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then, go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BobDyn/BobDocs) and click the green **"Compare & pull request"** button.

## Advanced Features

### Sidebars & "On this page"

The right-hand "On this page" menu is automatic! It pulls from your `##` and `###` headings. The left-hand sidebar order determines the "Next" and "Previous" buttons at the bottom of the page.

### Custom Components

If you need complex interactive plots (like a PID simulator), we use Vue components. You can drop them into Markdown like this:

```markdown
<PIDPlot />
```

Check `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/` to see what's available.
